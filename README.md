Mission: becoming senior level data engineer
Timeline: 12 weeks
Daily commitment rules:
                1. Total 90 minutes of focused tracked work 
                            - 90 min block or two 45 min blocks
                            - no zero days ever
                2. Every day must produce a tangible artifact
                            -notebook, md file, code, diagram, commit, notes, case study, etc.
                            -learning without creation does not count
                3. Daily proof log update
                            - record minutes, artifacts, insight, status
                            - public in github
                4. Mobility : minimum 10 minutes daily - intesity can vary, identity does not
                5. Time slot discipline:
                            WFH: 12:00 - 13:30
                            WFO: 7:30 - 9:00
                6. No dopamine traps


            Failure definition: 
                not completing 90 minutes in a day, regardless of reasons or schedule disruptions
                if failure happens write a post mortem - (root cause -> fix -> prevention) not excuses
